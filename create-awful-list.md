# 🚨 Creating Your Own *Awful* List

So you want to create an **Awful List**? That's… awful.
But also great. Follow these steps to ensure your list meets the *gloriously awful* standards of the Awful ecosystem.

---

## 📘 1. Read the Rules (Yes, Even for Awful Things)

Before you start proudly building your awful masterpiece, make sure you’ve fully read:

* The [**Awful Manifesto**](awful.md)
* The [**Contribution Guidelines**](pull_request_template.md)

Even awful things need structure—chaos does *not* mean low quality.

---

## 🔍 2. Search Before You Create

Before adding a new list, search this repository:

* Your list might already exist.
* If a similar list exists, contribute there instead of duplicating.
* Awful Lists don’t need siblings—just make existing ones even more awful (better).

---

## 🧰 3. Use Tools If You Need Help

Creating an Awful List manually is possible, but if you’re lazy (awfully lazy):

* learn from the existing list structures in this repo

But remember: laziness is acceptable; low effort is not.

---

## ⏳ 4. Let Your List Mature (At Least 30 Days)

Do **NOT** submit a pull request right after creating a brand-new list.

Wait **a minimum of 30 days** so that the list:

* Gains structure
* Gets real content
* Isn’t just 2 lines and a dream
* Looks less like a draft from 3AM

Aged lists are awful… but in a *classic*, beautiful way.

## 🧹 5. Meet the Awful Quality Checklist

Before submitting your list, ensure it:

* Has a clear, awful purpose
* Is curated, not autogenerated
* Has a proper description and sections
* Uses consistent formatting
* Contains only verified awful links/resources
* Follows naming conventions (awful-topic, awful-tools, etc.)
* Has badges (awful-badge, license, etc.)
* Follows repository structure standards
* Contains a valid README + LICENSE
* Has no broken links
* Is funny if meant to be funny
* Is educational if meant to be educational
* Is awful… but not unpleasantly awful

---

## 📤 6. Re-read Guidelines Before Submitting

When your list is ready, do the awful community a favor:

* Re-read the [**List Guidelines**](pull_request_template.md)
* Re-check your formatting
* Re-validate your links
* Re-confirm your list is actually useful (in an awful way)

Then submit your PR.

---

## 💬 7. Respect the Awful Community

Keep the spirit alive:

* Be kind
* Be constructive
* Be creatively awful, not destructive
* Appreciate feedback

Awful Lists thrive when contributors maintain the culture.
