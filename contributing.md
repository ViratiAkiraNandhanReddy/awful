## What qualifies as *Awful*?

A project is considered **Awful** if:

* It is **fully developed** and stable.
* It is **useful** to others (tools, scripts, utilities, libraries, etc.).
* It is **passively maintained**:

  * No active feature development.
  * Rare or no updates.
  * Still functional and reliable.

Projects that are experimental, actively updated, or in beta **do not qualify**.
