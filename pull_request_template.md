* [ ] Do **not** open a Draft / WIP PR. Only submit when fully ready.
* [ ] Provide a **clear, concise, and honest description** of the project.
* [ ] Review at least **2 other open PRs** and provide actionable feedback. “Looks good” alone does not count.
* [ ] Ensure the **URL points directly to the repository** and ends with `#readme`.
* [ ] PR title format: `Add Project Name`

  * ✅ Correct: `Add Retro Calculator`
  * ❌ Incorrect: `Add Awful Retro Calculator`, `update readme`, `adding retro calculator`

  * ❌ `- [Retro Calculator](...) - Awesome retro calculator project.`
* [ ] Add the entry at the **bottom of the appropriate category**.
* [ ] Titles of entries must be **title-cased**.

* [ ] No blockchain or crypto-related projects.
